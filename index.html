To use your github as a kodi file-source:

0) Kodi accepts only very-specific http-data as file-sources: 
   Thus, you must fake an Apache-style directory listing using 
   an "index.html" webpage in every directory from which you
   want Kodi to access using install-from-zip.
   (Use this html's source as a template.)
   
   These instructions assume you just want access to a repo's
   .zip file located in the root of your github project.
   

1) Note the github url for your index.html file...
     https://github.com/<font color=red>UserName</font>/<font color=red>ProjectName</font>/blob/master/index.html

2) Visit rawgit.com and copy/paste the above URL into the box
   there, to generate rawgit links. Copy the dev link and 
   visit it in a browser to verify the page looks right.
   The link should look like:
     https://rawgit.com/<font color=red>UserName</font>/<font color=red>ProjectName</font>/master/index.html

3) You can now point Kodi to your github using this link, BUT
   you must chop the "index.html" off the end of it, like so:
     https://rawgit.com/<font color=red>UserName</font>/<font color=red>ProjectName</font>/master/
   Note you must retain the final "/" slash!!
